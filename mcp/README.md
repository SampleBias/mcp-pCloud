# pCloud MCP Server

This project implements a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for pCloud, allowing AI systems to interact with your pCloud storage through a standardized interface.

## Features

- List folder contents
- Create, rename, and delete folders
- Upload and download files
- Search for files and folders
- Get file/folder metadata
- Share files and folders
- Copy and move files
- Get account information

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- A pCloud account with an OAuth access token

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pcloud-mcp.git
cd pcloud-mcp
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install mcp "mcp[cli]" requests
```

## Configuration

You need to set up your pCloud access token as an environment variable:

```bash
export PCLOUD_ACCESS_TOKEN="your_access_token_here"
```

Or on Windows:
```
set PCLOUD_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token_here
```

Alternatively, you can edit the `src/config.py` file to set your token directly:
```python
PCLOUD_ACCESS_TOKEN = "your_access_token_here"
```

### Getting a pCloud Access Token

1. Register your application on the [pCloud Console](https://docs.pcloud.com/oauth/index.html)
2. Run the helper script:
   ```bash
   cd src
   python get_pcloud_token.py
   ```
3. Follow the prompts to enter your CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET, then authorize in your browser

## Usage

### Running the MCP Server

To start the server in development mode:

```bash
cd mcp/src
python -m mcp dev pcloud_mcp_server.py
```

### Integrating with AI Systems

This MCP server can be used with any AI system that supports the Model Context Protocol. Examples include:

- Cursor IDE
- Claude Desktop
- Custom applications built with the MCP client

### Claude Desktop Configuration

To connect this MCP server to Claude Desktop:

1. Make sure your server is running: 
   ```bash
   cd mcp/src
   python -m mcp dev pcloud_mcp_server.py
   ```

2. Launch Claude Desktop and go to Settings > Model Context Protocol

3. Add a new MCP connection with the following details:
   - **Name**: pCloud Storage
   - **Transport**: HTTP
   - **URL**: http://localhost:8000
   - **Description** (optional): Access files in my pCloud storage
   - **Icon** (optional): üìÅ or üóÇÔ∏è

4. Save your configuration and enable the connection

5. You can now ask Claude to interact with your pCloud storage, for example:
   - "Show me my pCloud files"
   - "Upload this document to my pCloud"
   - "Find all images in my pCloud storage"
   - "Share a specific file from my pCloud"

### Example Flow

1. Start the MCP server
2. Connect your MCP-compatible AI application to the server
3. Ask the AI to perform operations on your pCloud storage, such as:
   - "List all files in my root folder"
   - "Upload this document to my 'Work' folder"
   - "Search for images in my 'Photos' folder"
   - "Share my presentation file with my team"
